# Truth Camera
The Truth Camera is a blockchain-based camera that provides trustful forensic evidence collection, self-certification of media public trust, and anti-AI forgery capabilities. It is designed to be used in situations where the authenticity and integrity of visual media are critical, such as in legal or journalistic contexts.

## 🔧 How it works

The Trustful Camera uses blockchain technology to create a tamper-proof chain of custody for visual media. Each time a photo or video is taken with the camera, it is automatically timestamped and stored on a blockchain. This ensures that the media can be traced back to its source and that it has not been altered or manipulated in any way.

In addition to the blockchain-based chain of custody, the Trustful Camera also includes anti-AI forgery capabilities. This involves embedding digital watermarks into the media that can be used to detect any attempts to alter or manipulate the media using AI or other digital tools.
